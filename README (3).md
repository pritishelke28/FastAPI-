# AI Trade Opportunities API

## Overview
AI Trade Opportunities is a full-stack application that analyzes a given industry sector and generates an AI-powered market analysis report.

The system uses a **FastAPI backend**, integrates with **Google Gemini AI**, and provides a simple **web interface** for users to interact with the API.

Users can enter a sector (e.g., technology, pharmaceuticals, finance) and receive a structured analysis including market trends, trade opportunities, and potential risks.

Note : This is just a backend server not end to end web application.
